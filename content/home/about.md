# About me 
I am a public health professional, currently working as an independent consultant on different projects for German and international organizations. I have experience in communication and advocacy, project and event management and in strategy development. 

Currently I work with  [MOOVE GmbH](https://www.my-moove.de)  which focuses on health promotion and disease prevention at the workplace. I give seminars and workshops that focus on healthy living, with a particular focus on stress prevention and management.

And I work for [SOPS](https://sops.de), which focuses on bringing together social projects and sponsors throughout Germany. I help developing a national network of organizations and sponsors as well as with marketing and communication.
