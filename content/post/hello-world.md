For many years I have been interested in mental health promotion and what we need to do to prevent and manage anxiety and depression as well as thrive at work, in school and in life. At EuroHealthNet I was contributing to the Healthy Workplaces Manage Stress Campaign, ran by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, EU – OSHA. I wrote a policy brief on “Mental Health Promotion at work” and I organized an EU debate on Mental Health with expert from different member states and the European Commission. 

My mindfulness projects
Since 2010 I have been practicing mindfulness meditation.  I went on a Zen Buddhist meditation retreat in Plum Village in Bordeaux in January 2019. And after reading a lot about the benefits of meditation on mental health and wellbeing as well as experiencing the benefits myself over the years, I took a meditation teacher training at the [Interdependence Project in New York](https://theidproject.org) which I completed in May 2019. 

Since January 2020 I have been working with MOOVE GmbH giving stress prevention and management at work workshops at workplaces and teaching relaxation exercises such as meditation or breathing techniques. During the COVID19 lockdown I taught online meditation classes for “rising pineapples”, an organization focused on women empowerment. 

I focus on Mindfulness and Metta (or Loving Kindness) Meditation. Mindfulness is a practice which teaches us to be fully present and aware. Metta meditation helps us to increase and expand positive feelings towards ourselves and others. Both meditation techniques have proven health benefits and help reducing stress, anxiety and increasing focus and concentration. Metta meditation has an additional benefit of helping reduce anger and increase kindness and compassion [for more information](https://centerhealthyminds.org).
