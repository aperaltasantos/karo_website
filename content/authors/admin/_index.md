I am an MD and a Public Health Specialist, with eight years of professional experience in the area of Public Health, Health Policy. I worked for international organizations such as the WHO and the European Commission, as well as national governments and local health organizations. During my public health training academically I received education from the Harvard Medical School in clinical research.

My career and interest have been moving towards a global health focus, primarily studying the impact of health policies, to advance that field I was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to do a Ph.D. at the University of Washington.
