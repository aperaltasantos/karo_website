abstract: We report on a case of imported human rabies in Portugal, in July 2011 in a woman who presented initially complaining of back pain, without relating exposure to animal bites. She had travelled from Portugal to Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, in April where she had been bitten by a dog on 1 May. She was diagnosed with rabies on 26 July and died two weeks later in spite of being treated following the Milwaukee protocol.
