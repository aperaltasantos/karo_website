I have been working in advocacy, communication, project and event management as well as in network and strategy development with different international organizations in the EU and in the US. I worked in Brussels for EuroHealthNet coordinating EU projects, with CCRI as an EU project and network manager and with the Ministry of Health in Luxembourg as a Campaign manager for a national alcohol prevention campaign.
